Mario Jumps, runs and walks across each level and the worlds are full of enemies, platforms and holes. Already Sonic (the fastest blue hedgehog) have to save the world from Dr. Eggman Robotnik (the biggest villain in the game), curling into a ball to attack enemies, collecting power-up rings, avoiding obstacles and enemies. Both are good and famous games but fans get into discussion saying “Mario is better than Sonic” and vice versa."
