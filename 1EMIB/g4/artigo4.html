                ALICE IN BORDERLAND / ROUND 6:
Main features of these series are that it has many Asian characters ended up in games and whoever wins the games comes out alive, but for those who lose comes to pass away.
The characters in ROUND6 enter the game because of very high debts and that they would not have money to pay, and this game if he won would earn a lot of money.

                In the ALICE IN BORDERLAND series, players seem to be transported to a different world or just an illusion. Players have to participate in games and when the game ends whoever wins receives a deck of cards, and to leave the place where they ended up, the only way was to complete an entire deck to exit the game.
The content of ALICE IN BORDERLAND is better, but the effects and recordings are better than ROUND 6.
ROUND 6 was a huge success and was one of the most loved in the Netflix community.
The characters in ROUND 6 are more natural for acting out the scenes in general in the series. Visual effects are better done and give a more real impression.
I recommend ROUND 6 because it causes more emotions than ALICE IN BORDERLAND. But if you like a series with better content ALICE IN BORDERLAND is better
