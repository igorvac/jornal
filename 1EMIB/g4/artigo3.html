                TECHNOLOGICAL AND TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS:
                Technological schools have the same subjects as a traditional one, but contain at least one more subject focused on technology and vision for the future.

In these classes they learn how to handle a computer the right way, make websites, applications and, as mentioned above, teachers encourage them to pursue a good future and have a vision for business.
                I was a student at a traditional school, but this year I joined FIAP and I can say that my vision is already different.
                In traditional schools, on the other hand, you delve into conventional subjects, thus having to work hard to stand out in a job in the future.
                Between a school and a traditional one, the technological one brings much more advantages and sometimes the difference in the price of tuition fees is not as big as that of a traditional one. They are better for the future of your children and the future of our country.
