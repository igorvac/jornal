            <p>Today we are going to compare the Fast and the Furious 1 with the Fast and the Furious 9, as time went by, the film evolved, but it ended up leaving a little of the original proposal, in the first film of the saga the film was focused on cars and racing, already in the last movie of the franchise the movie was more oriented towards something more fictional, with characters going to space, etc. That's why fans of the franchise say that the first movie is better than the last.</p>

            Over time, the film was making an absurd success, being difficult to find a person who did not know the fast and furious film, the saga became a worldwide success. Many fans say they prefer the earlier movies because the movie focused on more cars, the newer ones don't focus so much on cars but are still successful. In 2013 there was the death of one of the main characters Paul Walker who played Brian, the cause of death was an accident in which the actor was in the passenger of a career porsche gt when the car hit a tree.
