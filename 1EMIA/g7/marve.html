                    Avengers is a movie that shows some heroes who want to save the planet.
                    But we have another universe of heroes that a lot of people talk about and discuss which is the best, which is the justice league.
                    The Justice League has the same intent as the Avengers, but they are different characters and villains.
                    Some of these comparisons are:
                    Iron man is richer than batman;
                    The green arrow is stronger than archer hawk;
                    Flash is faster than mercury.
                </p>
