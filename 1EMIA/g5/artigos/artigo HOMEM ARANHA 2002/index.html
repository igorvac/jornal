            <h1>Spider-Man</h1>

            <p>After being bitten by a genetically modified spider in a scientific demonstration, young nerd Peter Parker gains superpowers. Initially, he intends to use them to earn money, adopting the name Spider-Man and performing in exhibition fights. However, when witnessing the murder of his uncle Ben and feeling guilty, Peter decides no longer to use his powers for his own advantage, but to face evil, having as his first big challenge the psychotic Green Goblin.               Still, the items mentioned above are far from being the biggest issues in the narrative. Who suffers the biggest loss are the characters. From the villain to the hero, from the protagonist to the most minor. The script adopts as a constant the fact that none of the characters seem to suffer from the duality of the difficult choices presented before them. Standing face to face with the man who killed his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), Peter is gripped by anger and the desire to kill the killer. At the same time, he has in mind that avenging his loved one's death would turn him into something that goes against everything his uncles tried to teach him in life. Thus, it is almost comical to see that the script proposes the most convenient possible solution to the dilemma: the murderer dies after tripping and falling from the top of a window.</p>

                <p> Despite the stumbles in the Spider-Man script, Raimi is effective at directing agile and fluid sequences of the hero. Both the duels with the Green Goblin and the scenes in which he saves the population from common dangers are well balanced and fun, sparking curiosity about the arachnid's narrative and creative potential, and, consequently, what will come in the sequels. Tobey Maguire, despite having many limitations in dramatic scenes, delivers an affable and accessible Peter Parker in a light film that differs greatly from its successors, but is brave enough to leave his mark on history, at a time when there weren't an abundance of references or production factories about the complexity of being a hero in the contemporary world.</p>
