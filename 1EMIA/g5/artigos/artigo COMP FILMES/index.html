            <p>Spider-Man: Featured in Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and Spider-Man 3 (2007), Tobey Maguire was the first actor to bring Spider-Man to life on the big screen. The original trilogy was a huge success and adapted the main story points of Peter Parker, an ordinary boy who gains arachnid powers after being bitten by a genetically modified spider.

                Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker is a typical nerd who is bullied at school, can't be separated from his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) and has a secret crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the popular girl at school.
                
                The original trilogy shows the character's maturity and can be considered a milestone in cinema. A protagonist for no one to fault!
                The look of the production is special as it manages to balance several different styles. This animated world has several references to comics – such as the noise of sounds and frames of thought – and everything happens in such a natural way that it makes this the film that talks best to comics. The interesting thing is that Miles, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, who are the protagonists, have a style more similar to this world, but the other Spiders are direct references to other animation styles.

                <p>Spider-Man in the Spiderverse is the movie Sony needed. The producer no longer knew how to use the character in live actions – so much so that it partnered with Marvel Studios that gave rise to the franchise starring Tom Holland – and now it's right to put the hero in an animation, changing the protagonist and us giving a new hero to follow: Miles Morales.
