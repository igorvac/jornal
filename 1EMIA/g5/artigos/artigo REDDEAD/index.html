            <p>The story is set in 1899 in a fictional representation of the western, midwestern and southern United States and follows the outlaw Arthur Morgan, who must deal with the decline of the Old West and survive the persecution of government forces, rival gangs and other opponents. The game's storyline works like a prequel to the first game. Again you take control of an outlaw. This time it's Arthur Morgan, one of the oldest and most loyal members of the gang who, after an unsuccessful robbery in a western town called Blackwater, needs to take refuge in the heart of the United States with his allies to escape the authorities and rise again. Rockstar's proposal for Red Dead Redemption 2 has always been to immerse the player in the game in a way never seen before. For this, the way in which most of the activities are inserted in the game make them much more a daily routine than tasks that can simply be left out.

                To be more specific, your daily life in the world of Red Dead 2 is not just about choosing and completing missions, but solving a series of tasks, like problems of normal life. At a certain point in the game, Arthur returned after a long hunt, and a simple dialogue with a hostage turned it into a new mission to be solved by his gang. Or when a simple trip to the city turned into a rescue adventure for a damsel in distress in the forest. Games like Just Cause 3, Far Cry 5 and Ghost Recon Wildlands bring thousands of virtual miles to play for hours and hours of exploration, but none of them come close to what Rockstar has done with Red Dead Redemption 2.                                                                                                                                   As the plot progresses, the huge map starts to be revealed, even if in the first moments it is already possible to slide through it completely hidden and get a sense of the grandeur. The way in which it is explored makes you realize its breadth. Starting with the paths, as there are no cars, speedboats or aircraft that hit 300km/h, only horses that, even the fastest, do not exceed 50 km/h. In Red Dead Redemption 2 they are not only mere animals used for transport, but also one of the biggest supporting characters in the game. This special attention starts with the care you need to be with them. No leaving the horse cold, carrying more weight than it can handle, or simply leaving the animal hungry.

                    The game requires you to treat them with care and attention, after all, they will be your best friends along the way. For this, you need to pay attention to your horse's status bars located near where your information is. For example, after a very long trot, your pet's breath bar starts to decrease, if it reaches the end, you can even get knocked over with a sudden stop. And when it feels cold/hot or hungry, this same bar decreases at a greater speed. Red Dead Redemption 2 manages to surpass all expectations and arrives as one of the best games of all time. With a bold and well executed proposal to create an immersion never seen before in a game, the title makes the player feel inside the heart of the USA, along with a work that takes the title's look to a new level.
