            <p>Grand Theft Auto V has arrived to set records in Rockstar's most popular franchise. The fifth title not only added one more number to the series, but its controversial formula and success story made it the biggest release in entertainment history and the best-selling product in less time.

                Released on September 17, 2013, the title not only gave a new face to the series, but introduced several other elements - such as the multiplayer mode - as well as far more realistic graphics and mechanical innovations never seen before in a game of the franchise.
                
                GTA V marks a return to sunny Los Santos, inspired by real-life Los Angeles, on a map larger than the territories of Red Dead Redemption, GTA San Andreas and GTA IV combined. For the first time in the series, the game puts players in the shoes of three different protagonists who need to unite their skills to execute big robberies, in addition to taking care of their private conflicts.                                                                                                                                            Michael De Santa is a retired criminal who finds himself returning to a life of crime with the help of his formerly out-of-control personality Trevor Phillips. The two are helped by the young Franklin Clinton, a kind of handyman and newcomer to crime. Renewing the franchise's style of play, GTA V creates a plot centered on bank robberies, but leaves the player free to fully explore Los Santos. It's not just at this point that the game innovates; it allows each character to get on with his life while the player is in charge of one of his companions.                                Rockstar also introduced, for the first time in the series, a fully multiplayer-focused mode. GTA Online allows players to create their own criminal characters and explore a Los Santos fully online. Buying houses, cars or stealing, players can participate in more than 500 missions with players from around the world.

                <p>Many curiosities surround the production of GTA V. One of them is the amount of world records that the game has accumulated in a few days of release. Among the achievements is the best-selling entertainment product within 24 hours of launch. The game achieved an impressive $1 billion in sales, surpassing the records of the Call of Duty game.                              Its super production also earned it another record, being considered the most expensive game ever produced, having consumed US$ 265 million to make. In addition to collecting records, the game also won several awards such as "Game of the Year" and best soundtrack at the Spike Video Game Awards - and at other sites and events.

                    Like the other games in the series, GTA V has generated a lot of controversy and controversy due to its violent themes, mainly because it contains a scene that involves the use of torture by the protagonist Trevor. Another interesting curiosity is the game's dubbing. Seeking more credibility in the production of GTA V, Rockstar generated more controversy and hired real gang members and criminals to do voice acting for various characters.
