            <h1>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h1>

            <p>After being hit by a radioactive web, Miles Morales, a young black man from Brooklyn, becomes Spider-Man, inspired by the legacy of the late Peter Parker. However, when visiting his idol's grave on a rainy night, he is surprised by the presence of Peter himself, wearing the hero's costume under an overcoat. The surprise gets even bigger when Miles discovers that he came from a parallel dimension, just like other versions of Spider-Man.                                                     After Marvel solidified its cinematographic universe by presenting, for decades, its most famous comic book heroes, we arrived at a new moment: that of renewal. A few years ago, the chance to introduce a Spider-Man other than Peter Parker seemed more than impossible. Surreal, to put it more accurately. However, with the events outlined in Avengers: Infinite War we saw that even our heroes can bleed and, surprisingly, die. Taking advantage of the hint inserted by Thanos, Sony puts a new Spider-Man in the spotlight: the young Miles Morales.</p>

                <p>The various realities worked on in the comics (which can confuse those who do not avidly read each issue) are presented naturally in Spider-Man no Aranhaverso. In the animation directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman, the magic of the bounds unites with a somewhat brute reality, seen in the creative choices made by screenwriter Phil Lord (Law Angels). The viewer's connection with Morales is made basically immediately because there is a sincere approximation from the first scene - either with the relationship he has with his parents or with the admiration he has for the mysterious uncle -, and drives the film to gain a serious aura , it doesn't matter if it was done 100% by computer.                                                                    Spider-Man in the Aranhaverse represents a maturation of the Marvel universe on the big screen, which is very welcome considering the current and growing moment of discussions about inclusion and representation. A black protagonist wearing the costume of one of pop culture's best known (and cherished) heroes should not be seen as a surprise, but rather as an important step that will certainly hold its course going forward. Being a hero has no gender, age or color. If the hero is universal, anyone can wear the mask.</p>
